Run the boot.py file.

There are MANY issues and i would love if the community fixed them

You can also run the main.py file in the pypating systems folder to view the main pypating systems app. Its very bad i made it in 5 minutes

Pypating systems is an app where I upload operating system-like apps made in python so people can view them.

If you want to add your own app to the ps(pypating systems) app, upload the folders and files on a mediafire download and share the link to this youtube channel: KontoFontoDonto
